/**
 * Component-based atoms are rendered with these props:
 *
 * - `value`: The textual representation to for this atom.
 * - `payload`: The payload for this atom. Please note the payload object is
 *    disconnected from the atom's representation in the serialized mobiledoc; to
 *    update the payload as it exists in the mobiledoc, use the `save` callback.
 * - `save`: A callback which accepts a new payload for the card, then saves that
 *    value and payload to the underlying mobiledoc.
 * - `name`: The name of this card.
 * - `onTeardown`: A callback that can be called when the rendered content is torn down.
