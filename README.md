![Build status](https://circleci.com/gh/joshfrench/react-mobiledoc-editor.svg?style=svg)
![Dependency status](https://david-dm.org/upworthy/react-mobiledoc-editor.svg)

A toolkit for Mobiledoc editors written using React and
[Mobiledoc Kit](https://github.com/bustlelabs/mobiledoc-kit).

`react-mobiledoc-editor` supports the creation of
[Mobiledoc Cards](https://github.com/bustlelabs/mobiledoc-kit/blob/master/CARDS.md)
as React components. For existing React projects, this makes it possible to
build React components once and share them between Mobiledoc and other contexts.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-mobiledoc-editor
```

**Please note:** MobiledocKit and React are specified as peer dependencies,
and **will not** be automatically installed. If you haven't already, please
add `mobiledoc-kit`, `react`, and `react-dom` to your `package.json`.

## Usage

This package contains a number of React components suitable for building
your own editor UI.

* [`Container`](#container)
* [`Editor`](#editor)
* [`Toolbar`](#toolbar)
* [`SectionButton`](#sectionbutton)
* [`SectionSelect`](#sectionselect)
* [`MarkupButton`](#markupbutton)
* [`LinkButton`](#linkbutton)

The most basic usage with standard toolbar and empty editor is:

```jsx
<Container>
  <Toolbar />
  <Editor />
</Container>
```

Read on for how to provide more typical configurations to each component.

#### `<Container>`

This is the top-level component, which _must_ be present and wrap the rest
of your editor UI. It accepts the configuration for your mobiledoc editor
instance and is responsible for establishing the [React
context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html) which enables
the other editor components to work together.

Please note that by itself, `Container` only renders an empty root-level
component. At a minimum, you'll need to include an `Editor` component inside
it. In addition to the Mobiledoc-specific properties listed below, any known
React props (like `className`) will be passed to the root-level component.

The `Container` component accepts these Mobiledoc-specific props:

- `mobiledoc`: A Mobiledoc to be edited.
- `cards`: An array of available cards for use by the editor. Jump to the
  section on [Card-based components](#component-based-cards) for more detail
  on how to create cards as React components.
- `atoms`: An array of available atoms for use by the editor.
- `spellcheck`: Boolean.
- `autofocus`: Boolean.
- `placeholder`: A string to use as the placeholder text when the mobiledoc
  is blank.
- `options`: A hash of additional options that will be passed through to the
  Mobiledoc editor constructor.
- `serializeVersion`: A string representing the mobiledoc version to serialize
  to when firing the `onChange` action. Defaults to `0.3.1`.
- `onChange`: A callback that will fire whenever the underlying document
  changes. Use this to persist and/or serialize your mobiledoc to another
  format as it's being edited. Will be called with the serialized mobiledoc.
- `willCreateEditor`: A callback that fires when the Mobiledoc editor instance
  is about to be created. Takes no arguments.
- `didCreateEditor`: A callback that fires once the Mobiledoc editor instance
  has been created. Will be called with the editor instance and may be used
  to configure it further.


#### `<Editor>`

The `Editor` component is the actual editor interface. In its most basic form
it renders an empty editor with no toolbar. It accepts no Mobiledoc-specific
props, but will respect any known React props like `className` or `onDrop`.
(See the [How To](https://github.com/upworthy/react-mobiledoc-editor/wiki/How-To#drag--drop)
page in the wiki for more information on drag & drop.)

#### `<Toolbar>`

Creates a toolbar with a basic set of editing controls. While this may be
suitable for very limited implementations, the expectation is that most people
will prefer to customize the toolbar and this component is primarily presented
as a reference implementation. Please see the
[How To](https://github.com/upworthy/react-mobiledoc-editor/wiki/How-To#customizing-the-toolbar)
page in the wiki.

#### `<SectionButton>`

Creates a button that, when clicked, toggles the supplied tag on the section
under the editor cursor.

Takes one required property: `tag`, the name of the section tag. Accepts any
known React props, like `className` or `title`. The returned `<button>`
component will have a class of `active` when the corresponding tag is active
under the editor cursor. The active class name can be changed by setting the
`activeClassName` prop.

```jsx
<SectionButton tag="h2" />
```

Alternately, custom child node(s) may be yielded to render something other
than the tag name within the button:

```jsx
<SectionButton tag="ul">
  List
</SectionButton>
```

#### `<SectionSelect>`

An alternative to `<SectionButton>`. Accepts an array of valid MobileDoc
section-level tags (`p`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `blockquote`,
`aside`) in addition to any known React props such as `className`. If the
section under the editor cursor matches one of the supplied tags, the
`<select>` component's value will be set to match. When changed, toggles
the selected tag on the section under the editor cursor.

```jsx
<SectionSelect tags={["h1", "h2", "h3"]} />
```

(Does not support customization of the child `<option>` elements; primarily
meant as a sample implementation.)

#### `<MarkupButton>`

Creates a button that, when clicked, toggles the supplied tag on the selected
range in the editor.

Takes one required property: `tag`, the name of the markup tag. Accepts any
known React props, like `className` or `title`. The returned `<button>`
component will have a class of `active` when the corresponding tag is active
under the editor cursor. The active class name can be changed by setting the
`activeClassName` prop.

```jsx
<MarkupButton tag="em" />
```

Alternately, custom child node(s) may be yielded to render something other
than the tag name within the button:

```jsx
<MarkupButton tag="strong">
  Bold
</MarkupButton>
```

#### `<LinkButton>`

Creates a button that, when clicked, toggles the presence of a link on the
selected range in the editor. User will be prompted for a URL if necessary.

Accepts any known React props, like `className` or `title`. The returned
`<button>` component will have a class of `active` when an anchor tag is
active under the editor cursor.

```jsx
<LinkButton />
```

Alternately, custom child node(s) may be yielded to render something other
than the default label on the button:

```jsx
<LinkButton>
  <span className="icon icon-link" />
</LinkButton>
```

If you need to customize the link dialogue or use something other than
`window.prompt`, you may supply your own handler. This is a function that
should take three arguments:

- `message`: This is the default text prompt ("Enter a URL".)
- `defaultUrl`: If the currently selected text appears to be a URL, it will
be passed in this parameter. Useful for auto-linking.
- `promptCallback`: Once you've processed any user input (or the `defaultUrl`
param) you must pass the final URL to this callback in order to actually
link the selected text.

```jsx
function myPrompt(message, defaultURL, promptCallback) {
  let url = window.prompt(message, defaultURL);

  if (url.indexOf('file://') > -1) {
    console.warn('Unable to create local link.');
  } else {
    promptCallback(url);
  }
}

<LinkButton handler={myPrompt} />
```

## Component-based Cards

Mobiledoc supports "cards", blocks of rich content that are embedded in a
post. For specifics of the underlying card API, please see the [Mobiledoc Card
documentation](https://github.com/bustlelabs/mobiledoc-kit/blob/master/CARDS.md).

`react-mobiledoc-editor` comes with a helper for using your own React
components as the display and edit modes of a card.

To wrap your own component in the Card interface, simply call `classToDOMCard`
on it:

```jsx
import { Component } from 'react';
import { classToDOMCard } from 'react-mobiledoc-editor';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  static displayName = 'MyComponent'

  render() {
    let { isInEditor } = this.props;
    let text = isInEditor ? "This is the editable interface"
                          : "This is the display version";
    return <p>{text}</p>;
  }
}

const MyComponentCard = classToDOMCard(MyComponent);
```

Please note that your component MUST implement `displayName`. This is so the
editor and other mobiledoc consumers can identify your custom cards.

Once your components have been wrapped in the card interface, they can be
passed to a `<Container>` component via the `cards` prop, like any other card.

Card-based components will be instantiated with the following
mobiledoc-specific props:

- `payload`: The payload for this card. Please note the payload object is
  disconnected from the card's representation in the serialized mobiledoc; to
  update the payload as it exists in the mobiledoc, use the `save` callback.
- `edit`: A callback for toggling this card into edit mode (no-op if the card
  is already in edit mode).
- `save`: A callback which accepts a new payload for the card, then saves that
  payload to the underlying mobiledoc and toggles the card back into display
  mode. Can optionally be passed `false` as an extra argument to avoid toggling
  to display mode.
- `cancel`: A callback for toggling this card to display mode without saving (a
  no-op if the card is already in display mode).
- `remove`: A callback for removing this card entirely.
- `name`: The name of this card.
- `postModel`: A reference to this card's model in the editor's abstract tree.
  This may be necessary to do programmatic editing.
- `isInEditor`: A bool indicating if the card is displayed inside an editor
  interface or not.
- `isEditing`: A bool indicating if the card is in Edit mode or not.

## Component-based Atoms

As stated in the [Mobiledoc Atom Documentation](https://github.com/bustle/mobiledoc-kit/blob/master/ATOMS.md), "Atoms are effectively read-only inline cards." They are sections of rich content that only spans the space of a word or a sentence within a paragraph. The common example is an `@` mention within a block of text.

`react-mobiledoc-editor` comes with a helper for using your own React
components as the display and update the content of an Atom.

To wrap your own component in the Atom interface, simply call `classToDOMAtom`
on it. This example illustrates an Atom component which renders a button and saves the click count to the underlying mobiledoc:

```jsx
import { Component } from 'react';
import { classToDOMAtom } from 'react-mobiledoc-editor';

class MyComponent extends React.Component<Props> {
  static displayName = 'MyComponent';

  render() {
    let { value } = this.props;

    return (
      @{value}
    );
  }
}

const MyComponentAtom = classToDOMAtom(MyComponent);
```

As with Cards, note that your component MUST implement `displayName`. This is so the
editor and other mobiledoc consumers can identify your custom atoms.

Once your components have been wrapped in the atom interface, they should be
passed to the Mobiledoc [`<Container>`](https://github.com/joshfrench/react-mobiledoc-editor#container) component via the `atoms` prop.

Atom-based components will be instantiated with the following
mobiledoc-specific props:

- `value`: The textual representation to for this atom.
- `payload`: The payload for this atom. Please note the payload object is
  disconnected from the atom's representation in the serialized mobiledoc; to
  update the payload as it exists in the mobiledoc, use the `save` callback.
- `save`: A callback which accepts a new payload for the card, then saves that
  value and payload to the underlying mobiledoc.
- `name`: The name of this card.
- `onTeardown`: A callback that can be called when the rendered content is torn down.


## Development

#### Testing

Run tests with `npm test`, or `npm run test:watch` to start Karma in continuous
watch mode. The test script will automatically apply linting according to our
house style, but the linter can be run independently with `npm run lint`.

#### Running the Demo

A small demo of basic usage and simple card and atom integration is available under the
`/demo` directory. To start the demo server, run `npm start` from the project
root.
